# NoCAP
Hi and welcome to this project. This is the **No**vel **C**ompiler **A**utomation **P**rogram. 
## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive CLI for creating LL1 CFGs (potential expansion in the future) and parsers for said CFGs. If you would like to view it in terms of existing software it will be a less powerful clone of JFLAP in the command line. The language used is C++. 
## Roadmap (bolded is complete)
* **Port VSCode project to CLion for greater flexibility + better language features (03/19/2022)**
* ~~Revamp Dr. Bazzi's lexer code to be a general purpose lexer utilising a NFA (03/26/2022)~~ *(Abandoned for now)*
* **Utilize new lexer to develop a flexible regular expression lexer & parser (04/02/2022)**
* Revamp REPL interface by introducing command modules (04/09/2022)
* Implement extended BNF as the defacto syntax for specifying grammar rules (04/16/2022)
* Add feature to automatically generate RD parsers for LL1 verified languages (04/23/2022)

## Note:
Code will be published once ported to CLion
