Hi and welcome to this project. This is the Novel Compiler Automation Program. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive CLI for creating LL1 CFGs (potential expansion in the future) and parsers for said CFGs. If you would like to view it in terms of existing software it will be a less powerful clone of JFLAP in the command line. The language used is C++.
